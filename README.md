The Capacity Exchange (CapX) is a project focusing on [Global Approaches to Local Skills Development](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Movement_Strategy/Initiatives/Global_Approach_for_Local_Skill_Development) within and for the Wikimedia Movement. It establishes a sociotechnical platform for peer-to-peer connection and knowledge sharing to sustainably enable community-based capacity-building.

The aim is to create a methodology and service, which will serve as the structure for initiating mutual skills development globally, regionally, and locally. An interactive, online platform, backed by a database, will enable wikimedians to publish information about themselves, their affiliates, and informal groups. They will also be able to conduct searches, access information and to connect with each other in a way that reflects the Wiki's spirit and the Wikimedia Movement Strategy.

The Capacity Exchange (CapX) is available in Toolforge at https://capx.toolforge.org

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- NodeJS >=18

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WikiMovimentoBrasil/capx-frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd capx-frontend
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and comment the following lines in order to use the development server:

   ```bash
   LOGIN_STEP01_URL="https://capx-backend.toolforge.org/api/login/social/knox/mediawiki/"
   LOGIN_STEP02_URL="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:OAuth/authorize"
   LOGIN_STEP03_URL="https://capx-backend.toolforge.org/api/login/social/knox_user/mediawiki/"
   BASE_URL="https://capx-backend.toolforge.org"
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

You should now be able to access the project at http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute to the Capacity Exchange, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature
3. Make your changes and commit them: git commit -m 'Add some feature'
4. Push to the branch: git push origin feature/your-feature
5. Create a pull request on GitHub against the 'dev' branch

## Project Structure

The project uses Next.js 14+ App Router and TypeScript for better type safety and modern routing patterns.

## Authentication Flow

1. User authentication is handled through NextAuth.js
2. Session management uses server-side session tokens
3. Protected routes are grouped under the `(auth)` directory
4. API requests include authentication tokens in headers

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant NextAuth
    participant API Routes
    participant Backend

    User->>NextAuth: Login attempt
    NextAuth->>Backend: Authenticate credentials
    Backend->>NextAuth: Return token
    NextAuth->>User: Set session cookie

    Note over User,Backend: Subsequent Requests
    User->>API Routes: Request with session
    API Routes->>Backend: Forward with token
    Backend->>API Routes: Response
    API Routes->>User: Protected data
```

## Data Flow

The data flow is managed through the following components:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Global State] --> B[NextAuth Session]
    A --> C[React Query Cache]

    B --> D[useSession Hook]
    C --> E[useQuery Hooks]

    F[Local State] --> G[Form State]
    F --> H[UI State]

    G --> I[useProfileForm]
    G --> J[useCapacityForm]

    H --> K[Dark Mode]
    H --> L[Language]
```

### State Management

1. React Query for server state
2. Local state managed through hooks
3. Form state handled by custom form hooks
4. Session state managed by NextAuth

### Profile Management

1. User data is fetched through `profileService`
2. State management uses custom hooks (`useProfileForm`)
3. Form updates are handled through controlled components
4. API requests are processed through Next.js API routes

### Capacity Management

1. Capacities are managed through `capacityService`
2. State handling uses `useCapacityForm` hook
3. Capacity data follows a hierarchical structure:
   - Known capacities
   - Available capacities (subset of known)
   - Wanted capacities

### API Structure and Requests flow

1. API routes are organized by feature:

   - `/api/profile` - User profile management
   - `/api/capacity` - Capacity operations
   - `/api/profile_image` - Image handling
   - `/api/login` - Login operations

2. Requests flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Component
    participant Service
    participant APIRoute
    participant Backend

    Component->>Service: Call service method
    Service->>APIRoute: Make request
    APIRoute->>Backend: Forward request
    Backend->>APIRoute: Response
    APIRoute->>Service: Processed response
    Service->>Component: Final data
```
